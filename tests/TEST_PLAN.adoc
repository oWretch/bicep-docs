This document outlines the test plan for the Bicep-Docs project.

== Overview

The test plan covers unit, integration, and property-based testing for the Rust-based Bicep parser and documentation generator.

== Test Types

=== Unit Tests

* Test each parsing function independently
* Include edge cases and error conditions
* Use descriptive test names

=== Integration Tests

* Test complete file parsing
* Validate output format
* Test with real Bicep files

=== Property Testing

* Use property-based testing for complex parsing logic
* Verify round-trip serialization/deserialization

== Test Coverage

* Parameters parsing
* Resources parsing
* Types parsing
* Variables parsing
* Functions parsing
* Modules parsing
* Outputs parsing
* Imports parsing
* Decorator handling
* Error handling and reporting

== Test Execution

[source,bash]
----
cargo test --all-features
----

== Continuous Integration

* All tests are run automatically on pull requests to `main`
* Linting and formatting checks are enforced

== Reporting Issues

* Report test failures or missing coverage via GitHub Issues
* Include test case details and reproduction steps
