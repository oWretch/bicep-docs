Thank you for your interest in contributing to Bicep-Docs! This project welcomes contributions from the community. Please read the following guidelines to help you get started.

== How to Contribute

. Fork the repository and create your branch from `main`.
. Make your changes, following the coding standards and best practices outlined in the documentation.
. Add or update tests as appropriate.
. Ensure all tests pass by running `cargo test --all-features`.
. Commit your changes using the Conventional Commits format (see below).
. Open a pull request (PR) targeting the `main` branch.
. Participate in the code review process and address any feedback.

[IMPORTANT]
====
Do NOT manually edit the following files as they are automatically maintained:

* `CHANGELOG.adoc` - Generated from conventional commits during release
* Version numbers in `Cargo.toml` and `package.json` - Managed by semantic release
* Git tags and GitHub releases - Created by automated CI/CD process

All version management is handled through conventional commits and the semantic release process.
====

== Code Style and Standards

* Follow Rust idioms and best practices.
* Document all public functions, structs, and modules.
* Prefer safe code and avoid `unsafe` unless absolutely necessary.
* Use `cargo fmt` and `cargo clippy` to ensure code quality.
* Add or update tests for new features and bug fixes.

== Pre-Commit Hooks

This project uses https://pre-commit.com/[pre-commit] to automatically enforce code quality and conventional commits.

For detailed information about the pre-commit configuration, including installation instructions, available hooks, and troubleshooting, see the link:docs/PRE_COMMIT.adoc[Pre-Commit Configuration Guide].

== Locale-Dependent Tests

Some tests (such as those that verify localized output or translations) depend on setting the application's locale. The Bicep-Docs application uses a global locale setting, which matches real-world usage, but this can cause issues when running tests in parallel.

[IMPORTANT]
====
If you add or modify tests that set the locale (e.g., using `init_localization`), you **must** ensure they are run serially to avoid test interference.

- Use the `serial_test` crate and annotate such tests with `#[serial]`.
- Only locale-dependent tests need this annotation.
- This prevents nondeterministic failures due to global locale state.

Example:

[source,rust]
----
#[test]
#[serial]
fn test_localized_output() {
    crate::localization::init_localization(crate::localization::Language::English);
    // ... test code ...
}
----

If you see test failures where output is in the wrong language, check for missing `#[serial]` annotations on locale-dependent tests.
====

== Commit Message Linting

This project uses https://commitlint.js.org/[commitlint] to enforce the https://www.conventionalcommits.org/[Conventional Commits] specification for commit messages.

=== Rules

- *type-enum*: Allowed types are `build`, `chore`, `ci`, `docs`, `feat`, `fix`, `perf`, `refactor`, `revert`, `style`, `test`
- *type-case*: Must be lower-case
- *type-empty*: Must not be empty
- *scope-case*: Must be lower-case
- *subject-case*: No restriction
- *subject-empty*: Must not be empty
- *subject-full-stop*: No full stop at end
- *header-max-length*: 100 characters
- *body-leading-blank*: Required
- *body-max-line-length*: 100 characters
- *footer-leading-blank*: Required
- *footer-max-line-length*: 100 characters

=== Example

[source]
----
feat: add support for parsing function decorators
fix: handle empty parameter lists correctly
docs: update README with installation instructions
feat!: change CLI argument structure

BREAKING CHANGE: The --output flag has been renamed to --format
----
