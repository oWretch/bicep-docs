= Pre-Commit Configuration Guide
:toc:
:sectnums:

This document details the pre-commit configuration used in the Bicep-Docs project to ensure code quality, security, and conventional commit standards.

== Overview

This project uses https://pre-commit.com/[pre-commit] to automatically enforce code quality and conventional commits. The pre-commit configuration runs various checks including formatting, linting, testing, security auditing, and commit message validation.

Pre-commit hooks help maintain consistent code quality by running automated checks before commits are accepted, catching issues early in the development process.

== Installation

To set up pre-commit hooks locally:

[source,bash]
----
# Install pre-commit (if not already installed)
pip install pre-commit
# or
brew install pre-commit

# Install the git hook scripts
pre-commit install

# Install the commit-msg hook for conventional commits
pre-commit install --hook-type commit-msg
----

== Pre-Commit Hooks

The following hooks are configured and will run automatically before each commit:

=== Code Quality Hooks

==== cargo fmt
* *Purpose*: Ensures consistent code formatting across the project
* *Command*: \`cargo fmt --all -- --check\`
* *What it does*: Checks that all Rust code follows the project's formatting standards

==== cargo clippy
* *Purpose*: Catches common mistakes and suggests improvements
* *Command*: \`cargo clippy --all-targets --all-features -- -D warnings\`
* *What it does*: Runs the Rust linter with all targets and features enabled, treating warnings as errors

==== cargo check
* *Purpose*: Verifies that the code compiles successfully
* *Command*: \`cargo check --all-targets --all-features\`
* *What it does*: Performs a compilation check without generating executable files

==== cargo fix
* *Purpose*: Automatically fixes common Rust idioms and deprecation warnings
* *Command*: \`cargo fix --all-targets --all-features\`
* *What it does*: Applies automatic fixes for issues that can be resolved programmatically

=== Testing Hooks

==== cargo test
* *Purpose*: Runs the complete test suite
* *Command*: \`cargo test --all-targets --all-features\`
* *What it does*: Executes all unit tests, integration tests, and benchmarks

==== cargo test --doc
* *Purpose*: Validates documentation examples
* *Command*: \`cargo test --doc --all-features\`
* *What it does*: Runs doctests to ensure code examples in documentation are correct

==== cargo doc
* *Purpose*: Generates and validates documentation
* *Command*: \`cargo doc --all-features --no-deps\`
* *What it does*: Builds documentation and checks for documentation warnings

=== Memory Safety Hooks

==== cargo miri test
* *Purpose*: Detects undefined behavior and memory safety issues
* *Command*: \`cargo +nightly miri test --lib\`
* *What it does*: Runs unit tests under Miri to catch memory safety violations
* *Note*: Only runs library tests due to tree-sitter FFI incompatibility

==== cargo miri run
* *Purpose*: Validates memory safety of binary execution
* *Command*: \`cargo +nightly miri run --bin bicep-docs -- --version\`
* *What it does*: Executes the main binary under Miri to detect runtime issues

=== Security and Dependency Hooks

==== cargo update
* *Purpose*: Keeps dependencies up to date
* *Command*: \`cargo update --dry-run\`
* *What it does*: Checks for available dependency updates without modifying Cargo.lock

==== cargo deny check
* *Purpose*: Security and license auditing
* *Command*: \`cargo deny check\`
* *What it does*: 
- Checks for known security vulnerabilities
- Validates license compatibility
- Detects banned or problematic dependencies
- Verifies allowed Git sources

=== Commit Message Validation

==== commitlint
* *Purpose*: Enforces conventional commit message format
* *Configuration*: Uses \`commitlint.config.js\`
* *What it does*: Validates that commit messages follow the Conventional Commits specification

== Manual Execution

You can manually run pre-commit hooks without making a commit:

[source,bash]
----
# Run all hooks on all files
pre-commit run --all-files

# Run all hooks on staged files only
pre-commit run

# Run specific hooks
pre-commit run cargo-fmt
pre-commit run cargo-clippy
pre-commit run cargo-test
pre-commit run cargo-miri-test
pre-commit run cargo-deny-check
----

== Hook Configuration Details

=== Miri Configuration

The Miri hooks are specifically configured to work around limitations:

* *Library tests only*: Uses \`--lib\` flag to avoid integration tests that use tree-sitter FFI
* *Version check*: Uses \`--version\` flag to ensure clean exit without showing help text

=== Cargo Deny Configuration

The project includes a comprehensive \`deny.toml\` configuration:

* *Allowed licenses*: MIT, Apache-2.0, MPL-2.0, Unlicense, BSL-1.0, Unicode-3.0
* *Git sources*: Allows the custom tree-sitter-bicep repository
* *Security auditing*: Enabled for all dependencies
* *Duplicate detection*: Warns about multiple versions of the same crate

== Troubleshooting

=== Common Issues

==== Miri Installation
If Miri hooks fail, ensure you have the nightly toolchain:
[source,bash]
----
rustup toolchain install nightly
rustup component add miri --toolchain nightly
----

==== Pre-commit Not Running
If hooks don't run automatically:
[source,bash]
----
# Reinstall hooks
pre-commit uninstall
pre-commit install
pre-commit install --hook-type commit-msg
----

==== License Issues
If cargo-deny fails with license errors, check that all dependencies use allowed licenses in \`deny.toml\`.

==== Performance
Pre-commit hooks can take time on first run. Subsequent runs are faster due to caching.

=== Skipping Hooks

In exceptional cases, you can skip hooks (not recommended):
[source,bash]
----
# Skip all hooks
git commit --no-verify

# Skip specific hooks
SKIP=cargo-test git commit
----

== Continuous Integration

The same pre-commit configuration is used in CI/CD pipelines to ensure consistency between local development and automated builds. All hooks must pass before code can be merged.

== Benefits

The pre-commit configuration provides:

* *Consistent code quality*: Automated formatting and linting
* *Early error detection*: Catches issues before they reach CI/CD
* *Security assurance*: Dependency vulnerability scanning
* *Documentation quality*: Validates examples and generates docs
* *Memory safety*: Detects undefined behavior with Miri
* *Conventional commits*: Ensures consistent commit message format
* *License compliance*: Validates dependency licenses

This comprehensive approach helps maintain high code quality and reduces the time spent on code review by catching common issues automatically.
