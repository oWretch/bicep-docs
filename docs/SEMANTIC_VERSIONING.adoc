This project uses https://github.com/semantic-release/semantic-release[semantic-release] with the https://github.com/semantic-release-cargo/semantic-release-cargo[semantic-release-cargo] plugin to automate version management and releases.

== Commit Message Format

This project follows the https://www.conventionalcommits.org/[Conventional Commits] specification. All commit messages must be formatted as:

[source]
----
<type>[optional scope]: <description>

[optional body]

[optional footer(s)]
----

=== Types

* feat: A new feature (triggers a minor release)
* fix: A bug fix (triggers a patch release)
* docs: Documentation only changes (triggers a patch release)
* style: Changes that do not affect the meaning of the code (triggers a patch release)
* refactor: A code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature (triggers a patch release)
* perf: A code change that improves performance (triggers a patch release)
* test: Adding missing tests or correcting existing tests (triggers a patch release)
* build: Changes that affect the build system or external dependencies (triggers a patch release)
* ci: Changes to CI configuration files and scripts (triggers a patch release)
* chore: Other changes that don't modify src or test files (no release)
* revert: Reverts a previous commit (triggers a patch release)

=== Breaking Changes

To trigger a major release, include `BREAKING CHANGE:` in the footer or add `!` after the type:

[source]
----
feat!: remove deprecated API
----

or

[source]
----
feat: add new API

BREAKING CHANGE: The old API has been removed
----

=== Examples

[source]
----
feat: add support for parsing function decorators
fix: handle empty parameter lists correctly
docs: update README with installation instructions
feat!: change CLI argument structure

BREAKING CHANGE: The --output flag has been renamed to --format
----

== Release Process

=== Automatic Releases

Releases are triggered automatically when code is pushed to the following branches:

* main: Production releases (1.0.0, 1.1.0, 1.2.0)
* next: Pre-releases (1.1.0-next.1, 1.1.0-next.2)

Note: This project uses semantic-release's default branch configuration.

=== Manual Releases

You can also trigger a manual release by:

. Going to the Actions tab in GitHub
. Selecting the "Release" workflow
. Clicking "Run workflow"

=== What Happens During Release

. Version Calculation: Based on commit messages since the last release
. Changelog Generation: Automatic changelog generation from commit messages
. Version Bump: Updates version in `Cargo.toml`
. Git Tag: Creates a new git tag with the version
. GitHub Release: Creates a GitHub release with release notes
. Crate Publishing: Publishes the crate to crates.io (if configured)
. Binary Artifacts: Uploads compiled binaries for multiple platforms

== Configuration Files

* `.releaserc.js`: Main semantic-release configuration
* `package.json`: Node.js dependencies and release configuration
* `commitlint.config.js`: Commit message linting rules
* `.github/workflows/release.yml`: Release automation workflow
* `.github/workflows/ci.yml`: Continuous integration workflow

== Setup Requirements

=== For Contributors

No special setup required. Just follow the commit message format.

=== For Maintainers

To enable automatic publishing to crates.io, add the following secrets to your GitHub repository:

. `CARGO_REGISTRY_TOKEN`: Your crates.io API token
.. Go to https://crates.io/me
.. Generate a new token with "Publish new crates" permission
.. Add it as a repository secret in GitHub
. `GITHUB_TOKEN`: Automatically provided by GitHub Actions

== Development Workflow

. Feature Development: Create feature branches from `main`
. Pull Requests: Target `main` branch (CI will run automatically)
. Testing: All PRs to main are automatically tested
. Commit Validation: Commit messages are validated in PRs
. Merge to main: Triggers production release
. Merge to next: Triggers pre-release (if using next branch)

== Version Schema

This project follows https://semver.org/[Semantic Versioning]:

* MAJOR (X.0.0): Breaking changes
* MINOR (0.X.0): New features (backward compatible)
* PATCH (0.0.X): Bug fixes (backward compatible)
* PRE-RELEASE (0.0.0-alpha.1): Development versions

== Troubleshooting

=== Release Failed

Check the GitHub Actions logs for:

* Build failures
* Test failures
* Authentication issues
* Network problems

=== Commit Message Rejected

Ensure your commit message follows the conventional format:

[source,bash]
----
# Good
git commit -m "feat: add new parsing feature"

# Bad
git commit -m "Added new feature"
----

=== Version Not Bumped

Check that your commits include types that trigger releases:

* Use `feat:` for new features
* Use `fix:` for bug fixes
* Avoid `chore:` for user-facing changes
